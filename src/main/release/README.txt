   + jbosscache-core-3.x.y-all, everything including docs, demos and tutorials, no sources though.
   + jbosscache-core-3.x.y-doc, just the documentation.
   + jbosscache-core-3.x.y-src, a zipped up snapshot of the project root directory in subversion, which includes all sources, tests and build scripts.
