      <title>API compatibility</title>
   <para>
      Within a major version, releases of JBoss Cache are meant to be compatible and
      interoperable. Compatible in the sense that it should be possible to
      upgrade an application from one version to another by simply replacing
      jars. Interoperable in the sense that if two different versions of
      JBoss Cache are used in the same cluster, they should be able to exchange
      replication and state transfer messages. Note however that interoperability
      requires use of the same JGroups version in all nodes in the cluster.
      In most cases, the version of JGroups used by a version of JBoss Cache can
      be upgraded.
   </para>

   <para>
      As such, JBoss Cache 2.x.x is not API or binary compatible with prior 1.x.x versions.
      On the other hand, JBoss Cache 2.1.x will be API and binary compatible with 2.0.x.
   </para>

   <para>
      We have made best efforts, however, to keep JBoss Cache 3.x both binary and API compatible with 2.x.  Still,
      it is recommended that client code is updated not to use deprecated methods, classes and configuration files.

      <title>Wire-level interoperability</title>

   <para>
      A configuration parameter, <literal>Configuration.setReplicationVersion()</literal>, is available and is used
      to control the wire format of inter-cache communications.  They can be wound back from more
      efficient and newer protocols to "compatible" versions when talking to older releases.
      This mechanism allows us to improve JBoss Cache by using more efficient wire formats while
      still providing a means to preserve interoperability.

      <title>Compatibility Matrix</title>
      <para>
         A <ulink url="http://www.jboss.org/jbosscache/compatibility/index.html">compatibility matrix</ulink> is
         maintained on the JBoss Cache website, which contains information on different versions of JBoss Cache,
         JGroups and JBoss Application Server.
